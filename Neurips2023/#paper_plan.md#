## Abstract
Main claim, there are examples that are inherently stable and others that are not. To first order, stability does not depend on the type of pertrubation.
Second claim: this is consistent with human uncertainty.

### Using statistical tests to quantify stability

#### Binary label
* Assume normal, sign of mean - t-test
* No assumption median - binomial test

#### Multi-label
* Using conformal prediction.

### stability of stability
using different methods of quantifying stability leads to similar results.

## Experiments

Currently CIFAR10, add CIFAR100 later.

### stability of stability

What we want to establish is that many examples are easy (agreement between models) and the level of disagreement according to different ensemble methods is similar.

### Binary

Contour plot to compare:
* Random starting point vs. bootstrap
* weak NN vs strong NN

Use CDFs of marginals and thresholds defining region of IDK where cases go to
next level.

Table of number of NN that predict + vs number that predict - make it into a 3D  figure.

### multi-label

Compare two classifiers.

* create a table with 0,1,2,3,4,>4 for each k,j compute: number of cases,
mean and std of L1 distance between distributions,

### relative to human
* Compare with cifar10H

### Anecdotal:

Give a few of the highly confusable examples (by humans)
